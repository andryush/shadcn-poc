## RecommendationBadge Component

The `RecommendationBadge` component is built using [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui)'s badge component. A shadcn
approach was followed for implementing dark and light mode functionality using `cssVariables: true` to ensure theme
consistency across the application.
